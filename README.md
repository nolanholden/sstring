# Simple String - a simple and safe string implementation in pure C

Simple String is designed with configurability in mind, to fit you and your team's needs as seemlessly as possible.

Furthermore, Simple String has prioritizes optimization of runtime complexity and space requirements through the use of minimizing semantic `typedef`s for things like boolean variables. You won't find any `0` or `1` literals in this library; only single compilation-unit `const` definitions are used.

## Issues and Pull-Requests Welcome!
Contribution to this library will be promptly considered and incorporated when accepted.
